TASK:
Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope.


Expected Behavior
When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console.

Actual Behavior
When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined, and messages do not log.

MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TASK:
Messages are not logging into the console/displaying in the console due to an error.
A variable has not been defined.
Need to define the variable/fix the JS to make it function correctly and display the desired message.
